## Team Roles

This project was developed collaboratively by our team. Below are the assigned roles and responsibilities for each member:

-**Backend Developer:**
Develops server-side logic, manages the database, and ensures API functionality and security.

-**Database Administrator:**
Designs and manages the database structure, ensures data integrity and security, and handles performance optimization.

-**DevOps Engineer:**
Manages deployment pipelines, automates builds and testing, maintains CI/CD workflows, and monitors infrastructure and application health.

-**QA Engineer:**
Plans and executes test cases, identifies bugs, ensures code quality, and verifies that all features meet functional and performance requirements.

> All team members contribute to testing, code reviews, and collaborative decision-making.

## Technology Stack

Below is a list of the technologies used in this project, along with a brief explanation of their purpose and role:

-**Django:**
A high-level Python web framework used for building robust backends and RESTful APIs efficiently, with built-in admin functionality and ORM support.

-**Django REST Framework:**
 A powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django, used to build Web APIs. It simplifies the process of creating RESTful endpoints for the application, including serialization, authentication, and permissions.

 - **PostgreSQL:**  
  A powerful, open-source relational database used to store and manage structured data with support for advanced queries and transactions.

- **GraphQL:**  
  A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It improves efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs, and is used to serve complex frontend data needs.

  - **Celery:**  
  An asynchronous task queue used to run background jobs such as sending emails, processing long-running tasks, and scheduling periodic tasks. It integrates seamlessly with Django and improves the responsiveness of the application.

- **Redis:**  
  An in-memory data store used as a message broker for Celery. It enables fast and reliable task queuing and also supports caching for performance optimization.

  - **Docker:**  
  A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.

- **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools used to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and faster delivery.

> This technology stack allows us to build a modern, scalable, and maintainable web application with both REST and GraphQL APIs, asynchronous processing, automated deployment, and a responsive frontend.
